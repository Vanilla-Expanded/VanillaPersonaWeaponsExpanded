	<description>Vanilla Persona Weapons Expanded is a mod that makes persona weapons a little bit more spicy - but only visually so. It never felt right that such a unique weapon does not actually look that unique - you can meet dozens of imperial royals, and all their persona weapons will just look like copies of themselves. I mean, youâ€™d probably customize your own weapon to be a bit more unique if you had it, am I right? 
	
With this mod, players not only are guaranteed a persona weapon of their choice and design upon reaching a rank of a Baron/Baroness, but every persona weapon in the game will now have a unique look. There is over 50 thousand different combinations, so I really doubt you will see the same looking persona weapon twice.

This mod requires Royalty DLC.
